## Abstract
Motion planning over cost maps generated via Birds Eye View (BEV) segmentation has emerged as a prominent approach in autonomous driving. However, the current approaches have two critical gaps. First, the optimization
process is simplistic and involves just evaluating a fixed set
of trajectories over the cost map. The trajectory samples are
not adapted based on their associated cost values. Second, the
existing cost maps do not account for the uncertainty in the
cost maps that can arise due to noise in RGB images, BEV
annotations etc. As a result, these approaches can struggle in
challenging scenarios where there is abrupt cut-in, stopping,
overtaking, merging, etc from the neighbouring vehicles.

In this paper, we propose UAP-BEV, a novel approach
that models the noise in Spatio-Temporal BEV predictions
to create an uncertainty-aware occupancy grid map. Using
queries of the distance to the closest occupied cell, we obtain a
sample estimate of the collision probability of the ego-vehicle.
Subsequently, our approach uses gradient-free sampling-based
optimization to compute low-cost trajectories over the cost
map. Importantly, the sampling distribution is adapted based
on the optimal cost values of the sampled trajectories. By
explicitly modelling probabilistic collision avoidance in the
BEV space, our approach is able to outperform the cost-map-
based baselines in collision avoidance, route completion, time
to completion, and smoothness.

**a.** **The histogram of constraint violation functions for each set in the elite set. At the start, multiple samples are spread out on non-zero values, complete convergence is achieved and at Iteration 10, all samples have values 0.**  
  
  
**b.** **Convergence of normalized costs with trace of covariance, signifying the samples are pushed towards good regions.**  







## Sources of Aleatoric Uncertainty
- Noise in RGB Images
- Noise in Intrinsics, error in GPS.
- Noisy BEV annotations
